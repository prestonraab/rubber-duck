# Rubber Duck Discord Bot

## Usage
The bot listens to the configured channel, currently set in the source code as `"duck-pond"`

When a user posts a message to the duck pond, the duck bot 
creates a public thread in response. 

To add a new listening channel, add a file named by the channel in the prompts folder.
The file should contain the prompt to use for each thread in that channel.
